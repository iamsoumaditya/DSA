# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms in C

Welcome to my **DSA practice repository**!  
This repo is a collection of clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental **data structures and algorithms** in C.  
It’s designed as both a personal learning archive and a resource for anyone revising core concepts.

## 📂 Contents

- **Linked List**
  - Singly Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal, reverse, search, min/max, middle element, Sorted insertion, Forward & backward display)
  - Circular Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal, reverse, search, min/max, middle element, Sorted insertion, Forward & backward display)
  - Doubly Linked List (insertion, deletion, traversal, reverse, search, min/max, middle element, Sorted insertion, Forward & backward display)
  - Applications :-
    - stack & queue with (push, pop, peek, display operations)
    - Dequeue (enqueue, dequeue, peek both side & display)
    - Priority queue (enqueue, dequeue, peek, display)
- **Arrays**
  - Basic operations
  - Sparse matrix
- **Recursion**
  - Tower of hanoi
- **Stack**
  - Array-based stack (isFull, isEmpty, push, peek, pop etc.)
  - Applications :- 
    - Infix to postfix & postfix evaluation
    - Infix to prefix & prefix evaluation
- **Queue**
  - Linear queue (isFull, isEmpty, enqueue, peek, dequeue etc.)
  - Circular queue (same as above)
  - Dequeue queue (same as above)
  - Priority queue (same as above)
  - Applications :-  
    - Undo / Redo operations

- **More coming soon....**
