# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms in C

Welcome to my **DSA practice repository**!  
This repo is a collection of clean, well-documented implementations of fundamental **data structures and algorithms** in C.  
It’s designed as both a personal learning archive and a resource for anyone revising core concepts.
